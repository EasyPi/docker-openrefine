[OpenRefine][1] (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy
data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending
it with web services and external data.

Please read the [wiki][2] to learn more.

### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  openrefine:
    image: easypi/openrefine:3.9.1
    ports:
      - "3333:3333"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      - REFINE_INTERFACE=0.0.0.0
      - REFINE_PORT=3333
      - REFINE_MIN_MEMORY=1024M
      - REFINE_MEMORY=1024M
      - REFINE_DATA_DIR=/data
      - REFINE_EXTRA_OPTS=refine.headless=true
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### install extensions

- Locate your workspace directory: ./data
- Create a new folder called `extensions` inside the workspace if it does not exist.
- Download the extension (usually as a zip file from GitHub, e.g., [openrefine-llm-extension][3])
- Extract the zip contents into the `extensions` directory, making sure all the contents go into one folder with the name of the extension.
- Start (or restart) OpenRefine.
